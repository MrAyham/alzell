# ChefMind Frontend

This project is a simple admin dashboard for the imaginary ChefMind restaurant.
It uses React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for authentication and database access.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Make sure to configure the Supabase credentials in `.env`.
